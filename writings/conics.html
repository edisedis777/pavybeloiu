      <section class="content">
        <p>
          It is a journey through time that began 50 years ago, when I was
          studying to become an architect. I started with simple drawings, then
          I saw how difficult the entrance exam was. I found some books in the
          high school library in Câmpulung, a geometry treatise for first-year
          architecture students. It was written by a famous professor, Adrian
          Gheorghiu. Here I found the construction of regular polyhedra, using a
          ruler and compass, starting from the pentagon and the golden section.
          I took the first steps towards projective geometry, then I found
          another book, by M. St. Botez, Descriptive geometry, then other
          textbooks on projections and affinity.
        </p>

          class="article-image magnifiable" />
        <p>
          I was fascinated by the constructions of the Greeks, thousands of
          years ago, with a ruler and compass, I discovered the mysteries hidden
          in the pentagon and then the Fibonacci sequence. I enjoyed the circle
          and its problems at school, in geometry lessons, then I went through
          Țițeica's Geometry, which I solved twice.
        </p>
        <p>
          From the circle, I got to the ellipse, then I took the difficult but
          fascinating path to the parabola and hyperbola. I made a beautiful
          ellipse out of thick plastic, like a glass, built with points, I cut
          it out of cardboard, then I sanded the shape of the glass with
          sandpaper. That's how I made them all, one by one, and I researched
          all their properties, related to geometric loci, tangents,
          intersections with straight lines, optical properties and finally, in
          space, the section cone and Dandelin's theorems.
        </p>
        <img

          alt="Precise geometric construction on A4 paper"
          class="article-image magnifiable" />
        <p>
          Areas and regular polygons have fascinated me since I was little, in
          the 6th grade, when I was 12 years old. Then Archimedes amazed me with
          his art and mastery, with which he calculated Pi and the sector of a
          parabola. I made the calculations on a notebook with squares, then I
          would build them exactly with plastic shapes. Finally, I transferred
          them to a large A4 format, where I would draw them precisely, without
          corrections.
        </p>
        <p>
          That's how I came to discover the mysteries of conics, which are not
          taught in schools. Who knew about radical axes, circles tangent to 3
          circles, or a regular tetrahedron in which 4 spheres are inscribed?
        </p>

          class="article-image magnifiable" />
        <p>
          At the same time, I was learning projective geometry, created by
          Gaspard Monge, one of the scientists who always accompanied Napoleon.
          I found the geometric projections and transformations, lines and
          planes, intersections of solids, all solved on my wooden table, which
          I found in the workshop of my uncle, Alexandru Donici, a great painter
          in Câmpulung. I went far and filled 10 notebooks with calculations,
          drawings and projections, all learned after school hours or during
          holidays, when my friends were playing in the hills and forests and
          were happy to be out of school. I had a spartan, army schedule, I
          would sometimes get up at 5 in the morning and study for 12, 14 hours
          until midnight. During breaks, I played tennis with 2 racquets made of
          plywood boards… I couldn’t find balls, because we were under communism
          and poverty was everywhere. I had time to study, and I was happy…
        </p>
        <p>
          Something about conics… They are fascinating, because they hide
          mysteries, still unknown… we always see them around us, as we open the
          door and go out into the street. Car wheels, steering wheels,
          bicycles, we all see ellipses, then parabolas, headlights, which
          illuminate us at night and mirrors, which transmit or capture signals
          from afar.
        </p>
        <img
          src="../images/geometry-4.png"
          alt="Geometric illustration of a parabola formed by a shadow"
          class="article-image magnifiable" />
        <p>
          The shadow hides the Pythagorean theorem and therefore equations of
          degree 2, like all conics. I found the hyperbola and under its graph,
          the hyperbolic functions. If we played with a candle on a wall, at
          night we would have all the conics, one by one, which changed with the
          inclination of the light towards the wall. Planets and atoms run on
          ellipses, the seasons also come from Kepler's laws, related to
          ellipses.
        </p>
        <p>
          These are just a few thoughts that I put into this little book, I
          carried with me, all the notebooks and sketches, across the seas and
          countries and thus I fulfilled my dream, that my work would further
          illuminate all seekers of beauty and truth.
